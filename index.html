                                Leadership coaching can be done in small groups of three to seven people, Scott will facilitate and guide your group into the process of figuring out the best course of action your group can take in situations. This is ideal for people who find their groups in a minor conflict, a desire for a breakthrough, or simply to increase productivity.
